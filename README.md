# FishDatabase
This program was created for myself to log the fish I catch while grabbing as much data as possible
(Fish Name, Amount, Size, Location, Wind Speed, Water Pressure, Air Pressure, Month, Moon Cycle,
Medium of the catch, Wind Direction, Air Temperature, Time, Visibility, Water Temperature, Humidity,
Water Clarity, 4hr, 8hr and 24hr change in Air Temperature, Water Temperature and Air Pressure)
This program also displays all the data stored in the database.
